## üìå Overview  
This write-up documents my experience completing the **SOC Simulator: Introduction to Phishing** module on TryHackMe.  

This was my first time running the simulator, and my goals were:  
- Learn how to triage alerts in a SIEM environment  
- Follow structured phishing playbooks  
- Practice documenting case reports with clear findings  

For this lab, I used the **Splunk Edition** of the simulator with the following setup:  
- **Splunk SIEM Dashboard** on one monitor  
- **Splunk Enterprise Console** on another  
- **Analyst VM** on a third  

The phishing investigation playbook steps used throughout:  
1. Assign the alert  
2. Triage the alert  
3. Analyze email artifacts (sender reputation, attachments, and links)  
4. Investigate related alerts  
5. Document findings in a case report

## üìä Summary of Cases  

| Case | Severity | Result | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Medium | False Positive | Clean onboarding email |

## üîç Lessons Learned  
- Always include **source and destination IPs** in reports for clarity.  
- Strengthen reporting for **True Positives** with detailed escalation reasoning.  
- Be cautious with **typosquatting domains** (e.g., `m1crosoft`).  
- Firewall misconfigurations can allow malicious traffic ‚Äî playbooks should include rule validation.  

---

## üìù Reflection  
- Time to complete was longer than usual since I was documenting step-by-step and learning the Splunk/Analyst VM workflow.  
- Correctly classified all alerts, though report quality can improve with more detailed IOC documentation.  
- Biggest takeaway: Writing high-quality SOC reports is as important as technical analysis.
